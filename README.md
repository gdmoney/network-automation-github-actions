# Network Automation Using GitHub Actions and Unimus


## Project Overview
Network automation framework based on the following **[GitOps Principles](https://opengitops.dev/)**:
- **GitHub** is assumed to be the [Single Source of Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) - all data related to the definition of the solution is documented here
- All device configurations are defined as `code` and stored in a [distributed version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) repository
- Configuration files are in **raw format** and use a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) language syntax to describe the **desired** system state
- All configuration changes are initiated via **Git** and are implemented programmatically via **GitHub Actions**
- Manual changes by directly modifying device configurations are **not permitted**
- Configurations are [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) - incremental changes are **not permitted**
- Devices' configuration is either fully replaced (`config replace`) via **TFTP** or a device is wiped clean when powered off and new config is loaded via **DHCP** upon reboot
- Rollbacks are simplified with a single command (`git revert HEAD`)
- Devices' **actual** state is continuously monitored and compared to the **desired** state
- **Alerts** are generated if any configuration changes resulting in **deviation** from the desired state are detected
- GitHub documents the entire history of past changes (who did what, when, and why) and all team collaboration (pull requests, issue tracking, comments)


## Solution Components
- GitHub repository - the source of truth for device configurations
- [GitHub Actions self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) - software agent that runs GitHub Actions workflow jobs
- [Ubuntu 20.04 Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) - hosts the GitHub Actions runner and the TFTP server
- [Opengear OOB access server](https://opengear.com/products/om2200-operations-manager/) - bare metal server running the Docker Engine
- [Unimus](https://unimus.net/) - network automation tool for mass config push, device backup, config audit, and drift detection
- [Slack](https://slack.com) - Unimus config change notifications, GitHub repo activities notifications, and GitHub issues actions
- [Pabbly](https://connect.pabbly.com/) - workflow automation tool generating GitHub issues from the config change notifications sent from Unimus to Slack

## Usage
**Workflow steps**
- Network operator proposes a change to modify a device(s)' configuration state
  - *Standard* change - a low-risk change that's pre-approved and follows documented, repeatable tasks
    - clone this repo
    - modify the device configuration files(s)
    - commit and push directly to the main branch
  - *Normal* change - a moderate or high-risk change that requires code review and approval prior to deployment
    - clone this repo, create a new branch and publish it
    - modify the device configuration files(s)
    - commit changes to the new branch and push to origin
    - create a pull request to submit proposed change(s)
    - pull request peer review
    - pre-deployment testing (functional/integration/performance) for complex and high-risk changes
    - pull request approval and merge based on validation test results
- GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
- Self-hosted runner starts running the job(s)
- Unimus starts the mass config push to the selected devices
- Static testing (syntax check/config validation) by the device NOS
- Devices' configuration is replaced and saved
- Operator gets a Slack notification describing the config change(s)
- Unimus continuously backs up and audits devices' operational state and generates alerts if config drift is detected
- If a device's configuration is changed manually, network operator will get a Slack message describing the change which will in turn automatically create a new GitHub issue
- Operator can take action on the issue directly from Slack (assign, label, close, reopen)
- Assigning a label will start a corresponding GitHub actions workflow to restore the device's modified current state config to match it's desired state config as described in the GitHub repo


## Build
**Download and run Ubuntu on Opengear**
```
sudo -i
docker pull ubuntu
docker run -it ubuntu
```

**Install required packages**
```
apt update && apt upgrade -y

apt install apt-utils curl git iputils-ping tftpd-hpa vim wget -y
apt install software-properties-common -y
```

**Install [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md), login to GitHub and store GH credentials in git**
- *Create a Personal Access Token: github.com > profile pic > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Generate new token: repo, read:org*
```
type -p curl >/dev/null || (apt update && apt install curl -y)
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
&& apt update \
&& apt install gh -y

gh auth login (GitHub.com > HTTPS > n > Paste an authentication token)

git config --global credential.helper store
```

**Create a new user and directories**
```
useradd -ms /bin/bash siteadmin && su siteadmin
mkdir /home/siteadmin/actions-runner && mkdir /home/siteadmin/actions-runner/network-automation-github-actions
```

**Configure and start the TFTP service as root**
```
cat /etc/default/tftpd-hpa
vi /etc/default/tftpd-hpa

TFTP_USERNAME="siteadmin"
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/home/siteadmin/actions-runner/network-automation-github-actions"
TFTP_ADDRESS=":69"
TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"

# start the TFTP service
/etc/init.d/tftpd-hpa start

# and verify that it's running
service --status-all
```

**Clone this repo**
```
su siteadmin
cd /home/siteadmin/actions-runner/
git clone https://github.com/gdmoney/network-automation-github-actions.git
```

**Modify file permissions**
```
chmod 755 _access.sh _core.sh _router_1.sh _router_2.sh
```

**Download, extract, configure, and run the GitHub Actions self-hosted runner**
- *Get the version number and the token from: github.com > repo > Settings > Actions > Runners > New runner > New self-hosted runner*
```
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.305.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.305.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.305.0.tar.gz

tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.305.0.tar.gz

./config.sh --url https://github.com/gdmoney/network-automation-github-actions --token <TOKEN>

./run.sh

Connected to GitHub
Listening for Jobs
```


## Troubleshooting
**After container or Opengear restart**
- *Verify that the Ubuntu container still has the .2 IP address*
- *Start the TFTP service as `root` and the GitHub Actions runner as `siteadmin`*
```
/etc/init.d/tftpd-hpa start
service --status-all

su siteadmin
cd /home/siteadmin/actions-runner/
./run.sh
```
**Reconfigure self-hosted runner after deleting it on GitHub**
```
rm .runner
./config.sh --url https://github.com/gdmoney/network-automation-github-actions --token <TOKEN>
./run.sh
```
